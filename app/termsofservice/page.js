      <p>
        I understand that the coaching services I will be receiving from Rachel
        Noelle, are not offered as a substitute for professional mental health
        care or medical care and are not intended to diagnose, treat or cure any
        mental health or medical conditions. I also understand that my Coach is
        not acting as a mental health counselor or a medical professional. I
        understand and agree that I am fully responsible for my well-being
        during my coaching sessions, and subsequently, including my choices and
        decisions. I understand that coaching is not a substitute for
        counseling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, mental health care or
        substance abuse treatment, and I will not use it in place of any form of
        therapy. I understand that all comments and ideas offered by my Coach
        are solely for the purpose of aiding me in achieving my defined goals. I
        have the ability to give my informed consent, and hereby give such
        consent to my Coach to assist me in achieving such goals. I understand
        that coaching is, at present, an unregulated industry and that my Coach
        is not licensed by the State of California. I understand that my Coach
        will protect my information as confidential unless I state otherwise in
        writing. If I report child, elder abuse or neglect or threaten to harm
        myself or someone else, I understand that necessary actions will be
        taken and my confidentiality agreement limited in this capacity.
        Furthermore, if my Coach is ordered by a court to provide information or
        to testify, he will do so to the extent the law requires. I understand
        that the use of technology is not always secure and I accept the risks
        of confidentiality in the use of email, text, phone, zoom and other
        technology. I hereby release, waive, acquit and forever discharge my
        Coach, any agents, successors, assigns, personal representatives,
        executors, heirs and employees from every claim, suit action, demand or
        right to compensation for damages I may claim to have or that I may have
        arising out of acts or omissions by myself or by my Coach as a result of
        the advice given by my Coach or otherwise resulting from the coaching
        relationship contemplated by this agreement. I further declare and
        represent that no promise, inducement or agreement not expressed in this
        agreement has been made to me to sign this agreement. This agreement
        shall bind my heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors,
        assigns, and agents.
