      "Rachel helped me learn how to love taking care of my body through exercise! She created a plan that was clear & easy to follow. She lives her life as an example of the importance of taking care of ourselves mind, body, & spirit. By following her plan I was able to gain confidence in the gym & consistency in my workouts. She helped me learn that working out is more than just losing weight & that itâ€™s a way to show myself the love that I deserve!",
