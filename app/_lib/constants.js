      "Rachel helped me learn how to love taking care of my body through exercise! She created a plan that was clear & easy to follow. She lives her life as an example of the importance of taking care of ourselves mind, body, & spirit. By following her plan I was able to gain confidence in the gym & consistency in my workouts. She helped me learn that working out is more than just losing weight & that it’s a way to show myself the love that I deserve!",

      "Over the past couple of years Rachel has taught me so many things that at the time I thought were far fetched and probably unattainable, but boy was I wrong!  I had always tried to be the one people could rely on when they needed something. I would try to fix everyone else’s problems all the while ignoring the elephant in the room of my life. I spent my whole life suppressing my heartaches and traumas that I had convinced myself I was “over it”. But deep down the ugliness of the past was churning and festering and wreaking havoc in my subconscious. I would blame all of my impatience, irritability and anger on others around me just getting on my nerves. All that negative energy was staring me in the face daily but I chose to ignore it. Rachel introduced me to outlets like meditation and journaling to address my past and to purge it properly. She taught me that if I didn’t put myself first, then any help I offered others would be fruitless. She has not only improved my emotional health but also my physical health by encouraging me  to eat better, incorporate yoga and to take any opportunity to get outside and refuel on nature and sunshine. I am still a work in progress, I am forever grateful for all of the coaching and tools she has provided me with to rid myself of the negative energy and replace it with positive.",
